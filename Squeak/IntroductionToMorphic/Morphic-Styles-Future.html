<h2>
A possible future for Morphic programming styles</h2>
Pluggable Morphs was done basically for backward compatibility. So, don't
expect major enhancements on them. Most new projects should choose one
of the more powerful styles.
<p>Dan Ingalls has stated the intention of merging the Classic and the
Scripting styles. We can expect to be able to choose between direct manipulation
and Smalltalk code for modifying existing morphs, regardless of how were
they created. May be, we could use both at the same time, working on the
same morph. This would give us both faster prototyping and the best maintainability.
<p>For Fabrik, both wired and wireless flavors will be implemented and
used by the Squeak community. Only after real experience with it we will
start thinking of its further evolution.
