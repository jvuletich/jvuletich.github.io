<h2>
Introduction</h2>
Morphic is the new User Interface in Squeak. It includes a framework for
building interactive graphical objects (morphs), that can be animated,
and a set of tools to support the Smalltalk environment. Morphs can be
built both interactively (by direct manipulation) or by Smalltalk code.
<p>The original Smalltalk-80 system included the first Graphical User Interface
(GUI) ever made. The system and its environment were first described in
[1], and later in [2], [3] and [4].
<p>The idea behind its User Interface was that any object in the system
should be easily and immediately accessible to the user. The original MVC
implementation in Smalltalk made it possible to build general and flexible
user interfaces for any object, but it didn't make it easy. MVC means Model-View-Controller.
Any object in the system could be a Model. A Model is an object that the
user is aware of. Generally a model does not need to know about graphic
displays or user interaction. A View and a Controller are usually made
to interact with the user. The View shows a visual representation of the
Model, that the user can understand. The Controller takes mouse clicks
and
<br>keystrokes and changes the View. For example, in a flight simulator,
a Model could be a world that includes different objects. It's View would
render a perspective of the pilot's sight through the windshield. The Controller
would allow to point and click to the visible objects, perhaps to make
some query on them. This design allows having multiple different views
operating over one single model at the same time.
<p>Later, when the Apple Macintosh popularized some of Smalltalk's visual
look, MVC power (and even the idea of Object) was lost. Even Smalltalk
environments failed at this. And the original intended book on MVC [5]
was never published. The "Inside Smalltalk" volume II [6] filled the gap,
but it was late. Commercial Smalltalk environments started to offer only
tools for building GUIs, by assembling of standard widgets. Non-Smalltalk
programming tools also followed this trend. So software developers started
to restrict their imagination to what can be accomplished by selecting
controls from a palette, and grouping them on a form.
<p>Morphic was originally developed by John Maloney and Randy Smith as
the Self user interface framework. You can read more about this at <a href="Morphic-History.html">History</a>.
Morphic takes again the idea of any object being visually accessible by
the user, but it s much simpler and easier than MVC, and it s more powerful
too. Thus, the set of morphs already included in Squeak is probably richer
than anything ever done in MVC. (If you don't know MVC, don't worry. Just
jump into Morphic. MVC knowledge is decidedly not needed to understand
and work with Morphic.)
