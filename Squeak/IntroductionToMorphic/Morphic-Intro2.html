<br>Morphic allows merging Model and View in a single Morphic object that
besides being a model, it also knows about user interaction. The controller
is no longer needed. This is simpler, but won't allow for different views
on the same model. If this is desired, model and view can be separated;
making a non-morphic object for the model, and a morph for the view. The
event propagation mechanism is available for communicating the view and
the model in the same fashion as in MVC.&nbsp; (The MorphicWrappers package
developed by the MathMorphs group avoids the need to build a view for every
model, by means of standard views or wrappers, which allows Morphic manipulation
of any Smalltalk object.) Therefore, Morphic is both simpler and more flexible.
It allows us to think in Models and Views or in Graphical Objects at our
choice.
<h3>
What are Morphs?</h3>
Morphic is based on a simple and general idea: Some objects can interact
with the user, knowing how to render themselves on a Display, and how to
react to user actions. They are called Morphs (From the Greek, shape or
form).
<p><font color="#000099">"In addition, a morph may:</font>
<br><font color="#000099">1.&nbsp; perform actions in response to user
inputs;</font>
<br><font color="#000099">2.&nbsp; perform an action when another morph
is dropped onto it, or when it is dropped onto another morph;</font>
<br><font color="#000099">3.&nbsp; perform an action at regular intervals;
and</font>
<br><font color="#000099">4.&nbsp; control the placement and size of its
submorphs.</font>
<br><font color="#000099">Any morph can have component morphs (called submorphs).
A morph with submorphs is called a composite morph. The submorphs are said
to be embedded in the composite morph. The submorphs can in turn be composite
morphs, to any depth. Each morph can be embedded in at most one composite
morph, so the submorph relation defines a tree of morphs. A composite morph
is treated as a unit; moving, copying, or deleting a composite morph causes
all its submorphs to be moved, copied, or deleted as well."</font>
