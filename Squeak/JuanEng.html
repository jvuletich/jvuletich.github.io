<p>I love Smalltalk, and specially Squeak. Here you can find Smalltalk
stuff I want to share. All this is free for any use, without any obligation
on you or warranty from me. The only I ask is to give credit to me in the
way you find appropiate.
<p>Squeak is powerful, portable and open source Smalltalk. It's being developed
now by the same people who invented Object Oriented Programming and the
Smalltalk environment in the 70's. Read more at the <a href="http://www.squeak.org">Squeak
Home</a>.

<font size=+2>Introduction to Morphic</font></h1>
Morphic is Squeak's new User Interface. I wrote this <a href="IntroductionToMorphic/Morphic.html">Morphic
Intoductory Article</a> that includes a description, some historic background
and the programming styles it supports. (I wrote it on 4/2000. Please note
that Squeak is constantly changing.)
<h1>
<font size=+2>PhotoSqueak</font></h1>
PhotoSqueak is my Image Processing project in Squeak. It started as a course
project, and the name "PhotoSqueak" was suggested by Bijan Parsia. (Thanks
Bijan!)
<p><i><u><font size=+1>PhotoSqueak 1.0</font></u></i>
<p>This is the lab project of the Image Processing course I took at the
University of Buenos Aires during the 1st semester of 2000. Some noteworthy
aspects include:
<ul>
<li>
Implementation of an important set of Image Processing algorithms and techniques.</li>

<li>
Use of the C code generation in Squeak for high performance numerical algorithms,
with full Smalltalk code too.</li>

<li>
Morphic user interface.</li>
</ul>
Later, I enhanced it, resulting in PhotoSqueak 2.0. But <b><a href="PhotoSqueak/PhotoSqueak1/ImageProcessingEng.html">this
description</a></b> is quite complete, and includes several screenshots,
so you can see what it can do. You can also download this version if you
wish.
<p><i><u><font size=+1>PhotoSqueak 2.0</font></u></i>
<p>This is the lab project of the second Image Processing course I took
at the University of Buenos Aires during the 1st semester of 2001. It includes
a lot of new algorithms, and an better UI. Anyway, it's still far from
a final user application.

<h1>
<font size=+2>Squeak port for OS/2</font></h1>
Being completely portable, people of it's user community have ported it
to most existing platforms. I did and mantain the <a href="SqueakForOS2/SqueakForOS2Eng.html">Squeak
OS/2 port</a>.
<h1>
<font size=+2>Scrabble</font></h1>
In a course on Software Engineering at the University I had to do a networked
<a href="Scrabble/ScrabbleEng.html">Scrabble
Game</a>. It is client/server, Internet based, and the GUI is Morphic.
