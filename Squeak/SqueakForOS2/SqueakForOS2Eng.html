<p>Being completely portable, people of it's user community have ported
it to most existing platforms. I did and mantain the Squeak OS/2 port.

<h3>
Squeak for OS/2 Warp</h3>
<b><font color="#FF0000">[UPDATED: 02/05/2001]</font></b>
<br><img SRC="SqueakonOS2.jpg" >
<p>This is a native, high performance Squeak port, wrote especifically
for OS/2. It uses DIVE, a game oriented display API from IBM, that uses
hardware acceleration to achieve fast display updates. The result is a
quite fast Squeak even on a 486 machine.
<p>I included a convenient mapping of several keys in the VM. Ctrl-Break
and Esc are the interrupt keys and, Ctrl-Ins, Shft-Ins and Shft-Del manage
the clipboard (emulating Alt-c, Alt-v and Alt-x). Besides all Squeak color
depth are supported from 1 to 32 bit. If you select a Squeak color mode
with more colors that your OS/2 desktop, color dithering will occur, giving
a very good illusion of having more colors than you really have.
<p>This version has support for sound and TCP/IP networking. It doesn't
still have support for MIDI, serial port or joystick. I will keep enhacing
it.
<p><b>System requeriments</b> (If you need lower requeriments, send me
a note. I might work on it)
<ul>
<li>
Long file name support (install Squeak on a HPFS or network drive)</li>

<li>
DIVE video dlls (Installed by default by OS/2 Warp 4 Multimedia Support,
but can be added to any OS/2)</li>

<li>
DART audio dlls (Installed when installing an audio card, but can be added
even without one)</li>

<li>
Video mode with at least 256 colors, and support for DIVE (any driver should
work)</li>
</ul>

<p><br>To unzip theese files, you will need an UNZIP program or similar,
for OS/2 or Windows, that supports long filenames. For example, this one:
<a href="unzip.exe"><b>unzip.exe</b>
(95Kb)</a>.
<p>If you want to see how it was done, or want to experiment with it, you
may also download the VM source files.</ul>
