<a href="Imagenes.zip">Imagenes.zip</a> (6.9 Mb) A full package, that includes
everything you need to run PhotoSqueak on Windows. Based on Squeak 2.7.
Just unzip and run Squeak.exe. If you are not using Windows, replace Squeak.exe
with the appropiate Virtual Machine for your platform, and erase all the
dlls. If you download this package, you don't need any of the other files.
<p><a href="Source.zip">Source.zip</a> (31 Kb) Source code for the project,
to file in <a href="http://www.squeak.org">Squeak</a> 2.7. It includes
the source for DLL generation. In newer Squeak versions, gives an error
because the QuickPrint class does not exist any longer. If this is your
case, modify in
<br>BorderedPopUpChoiceMorph >> fitContents

<font size=+3>Tips</font></h2></center>
The GUI is a bit strange. Please follow do as follows: Open an ImageViewMorph
(New Morph / Image Processing / ImageViewMorph). Create an image. Then
you can enter values, or load a file into it. See the meaning of the controls
for details.
<p>Try small images first. A monochorme image of 30 x 30 will be usable
even on the slowest machines. Use the zoom slider to magnify small images.
<p>Note that this GUI actually does not include a way to save aprocessed
image. It must be done by a script.
<br>&nbsp;

<h2>
<font size=+3>Controls by horizontal row, from top to bottom</font></h2></center>
<b>Top horizontal slider</b>: controls zoom (warning: slow if no plugin)
<p><b>Bottom horizontal slider</b>: Opens spreadsheet view of image (up
to 15x15)
<p><b>&lt;Update Image></b>: Updates image from spreadsheet view data
<p><b>&lt;ReZoom></b>: ReZooms the image based on the Zoom field
<p><b>&lt;New></b>: Creates a new image of the specified pixel type, width,
height and number of planes (0: monochrome, 3: RGB, others also possible).
Float images are better for most algorithms. Int16 are almost useless.
<p><b>&lt;Load></b>: Loads a file of the specified type and fileName on
the current image.
<p><b>&lt;Fill></b>: Fills the current inage with the selected noise distribution,
enter the parameters first.
<p><b>&lt;Calc new></b>: Select an algoritm to calc a new image, then click.
You can find histogram equalization, norm histogram equalization (for color/multiband
images), several edge detection techniques and local variance (in a neighborhood
of each pixel).
<p><b>&lt;Calc new></b>: Silimar to the last, but for algorithms tat take
an argument. Select an operation and enter the argument. Then click the
button. The argument is a number, except in #contaminateWithSaltAndPepper:
that takes an array of three numbers, like #(percentageToContaminate bottomValue
topValue). The operations include several edge detection algorithms, a
(slow) nonlinear median filter, the extraction of a plane/color in a multiplane/color
image, and the creation of a Gaussian Laplacian image (for covolving with
another image).
<p><b>&lt;Calc new></b>: These operations take another image as an argument.
So first get another ImageViewMorph with an image. Click on the gray box,
and without releasing the mouse button, drag to the other image and let
the button go. An arrow will appear, indicating the image choosen as the
parameter. If you move any of the morphs, and the arrow does not point
to the parameter anymore, just select the parameter again, in the same
way. Here you can find arithmethic operations on images (pixel by pixel),
and the most important operation in this package, the Convolution.
<p><b>&lt;Calc new></b>: This one evaluates the text in the box as a Smalltalk
block, on every pixel of the image.
<p><b>&lt;Threshold></b>: Every pixel whose value is greater than [Level]
is set to [Top] (if the [Top] value is entered), and every one whose value
is lower than [Level] is set to [Bottom] (if the [Bottom) value is entered).
It's useful when an image has very little values very far from the mean
value, and the stretching done to show the image lacks contrast. It cuts
the extremes of the histogram.
<p><b>&lt;Histogram> &lt;Norm.Hist> &lt;Smooth.Hist></b> are histograms.
Once you open the histogram, open a halo on the ImageHistogramExtendedView,
and extend it. Norm histogram takes the norm of each pixel in color/multiband
images. Smooth Histogram is used for image classification. Please try small
images first.
<p><b>&lt;Copy></b>: Opens a new ImageViewMorph with a copy of the image
in the current.
<p><b>&lt;Close></b>: Closes the view.
<p>In the Histogram view, <b>&lt;Loc.Min></b> find local minimum in the
histogram. Click on the view afterwards, to redraw the morph.
