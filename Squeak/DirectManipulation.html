                  <h1>Smalltalk, Direct Manipulation and End User
Programming</h1>

                  <p class="MsoNormal">This article is
about historic perspective on the original objectives of the Smalltalk
and
Squeak projects. It reflects my current understanding on these issues,
and I'll
gladly welcome corrections and materials for further study.</p>

                  <p class="MsoBodyText">The original
purpose
of the Smalltalk project in Xerox PARC was to make computing power
accessible
to anyone, especially kids. But it took a very long time to happen.
Only about
25 years after the project start, the Etoys system is ready and used by
kids at
school. In the meantime, other ideas and technologies were developed to
support
that long-term goal. They made their way into the professional
programmers'
world. Some of them are: object oriented programming, the Smalltalk
language
and environment, overlapping windows and context menus and direct
manipulation
guis. Let&#8217;s see some milestones in this road.</p>

                  <h2>Model View
Controller</h2>

                  <p class="MsoNormal">MVC (by Trygve
Reenskaug) was the framework for the Smalltalk-80 user interface. It
was
written in the Smalltalk language and it was meant to be used
(programmed) by
programmers. The way to design user interfaces using it was by writing
code to
describe the behavior of objects. The gui is built with objects that
the user can
manipulate in a limited way, i.e. the user can move a scrollbar, but
can not
modify its behavior without going to a browser to write the code. </p>

                  <p class="MsoNormal">Jecel
Assumpção
Jr. writes &#8220;The only thing I would add about MVC is that it
makes good use of
the fact that humans have a single locus of attention (chapter 2 of Jef
Raskin's
"The Humane Interface" goes into detail about this). So there is one
active object on the screen while all the others are frozen. Using the
pointer
position as a proxy for the locus, the Controllers collaborate to
quickly
switch which one of them is active. In a similar way, only the top View
can be
updated but as soon as the user is interested in a different View it
comes to
the top and is refreshed. I consider this to be the visual equivalent
of the
"block variables are really method temporaries" hack in that most
people don't notice any problems. Bill Atkinson from Apple was so
convinced he
had seen partially obscured windows being updated in the famous PARC
Smalltalk-80 demo that he worked long and hard to come up with a way to
reproduce this for the Lisa and Mac (what he called "region
algebra").&#8221;</p>

                  <h2>Alternate Reality Kit</h2>

                  <p class="MsoNormal">ARK (by Randy
Smith) was the first attempt at a direct manipulation user interface.
The idea
is that every object in the system has a physical representation on the
screen,
and each object's behavior can be changed by interacting with it. Even
though
it was implemented in Smalltalk-80 (a class based language with
browsers for
writing code), it goes on the path to assembly of objects instead of
programming, and thinking on instances rather than classes. ARK also
had
something that none of the later systems had: the possibility of
handling
physical laws, like inertial movement, forces, and gravity. Watch the
ARK video
at <a href="http://www.open-video.org/details.php?videoid=8050">http://www.open-video.org/details.php?videoid=8050</a>
.</p>

                  <h2>Self - Morphic 1.0</h2>

                  <p class="MsoNormal">The Self system
(by Randy Smith, John Maloney and others) is the crystallization of
many of the
ideas in ARK. It is completely instance-based. There are no classes. It
is
completely based on object assembly. There are no browsers. The
direct-manipulation gui is the only gui. All the definition of the
behavior of
objects (what we usually call "programming") is done by direct
manipulation. Therefore it is the most pure implementation of these
ideas. However,
programming in the Self environment is not easy enough to consider it
an end-user
programming system. Watch the Self video at <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5776880551404953752">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5776880551404953752</a>
.</p>

                  <h2>Squeak - Morphic 2.0</h2>

                  <p class="MsoNormal">Morphic 2.0 (by
John Maloney) is a Smalltalk framework for user interface based on
Morphic 1.0.
It allows direct manipulation and assembly of graphical objects
(Morphs) but
not of other objects. It requires Smalltalk programming of the Morphs.
Programming is therefore done by defining classes in browsers. It is
therefore
incomplete when compared with the ideas explored in ARK and implemented
in
Self. The main motivation for this work was to support the
&#8220;User Scripting
programming style&#8221;, later known as Etoys.</p>

                  <h2>Squeak - Morphic 2.0 - Etoys</h2>

                  <p class="MsoNormal">Etoys (by Squeak
Central) is an end-user programming system that implements the
programming
model of Self but is written on top on Morphic 2.0. The idea is to make
programming easy enough for non-programmers, especially kids. We have
two
environments: The Etoys environment, a Self like system based on
instances with
direct manipulation assembly of objects. And below that we have the
Squeak -
Morphic 2.0 environment, based on classes and programming with browsers.</p>

                  <h2>Tweak</h2>

                  <p class="MsoNormal">Tweak (by the
Croquet team) is a newer gui framework built to support a newer Etoys
like
system for the Croquet project. It doesn't rely on Morphic, but
inherits many
ideas from Morphic2 and Etoys. The end-user and the low level
programming
languages are a bit closer, although the first is still instance based,
and the
second is class based.</p>

                  <h2>MorphicWrappers</h2>

                  <p class="MsoNormal">The story is not
linear, and there were other evolutionary paths for these ideas. The
goal of
the MorphicWrappers project (by Luciano Notarfrancesco and Gerardo
Richarte) is
to complete Morphic 2 to make every object in the Smalltalk system have
a
physical representation. Therefore it can be seen as a modern
implementation of
ARK. It is not oriented at end-user programming.</p>

                  <h2>Scratch</h2>

                  <p class="MsoNormal">Scratch (by John
Maloney and others) is a media authoring tool similar in some aspects
to Etoys.
It is built with Squeak, and most likely, using Morphic 2. But it is a
closed
tool, in the sense that there is no way to access the underlying system.</p>

                  <h2>Morphic 3.0</h2>

                  <p class="MsoNormal">It is a redesign
of Morphic 2.0. It handles more general coordinate systems and
transformations.
Therefore Morph drawing is not specified in pixels anymore. It is
oriented at
programmers. It is implemented in the Squeak Smalltalk language and
environment. It could be used to support applications programming, but
could
also support projects like MorphicWrappers and Etoys.</p>

                  <p class="MsoNormal">It is my
intention with this historic review to show that although the main goal
of the
Smalltalk project is to make programming accessible by kids, much of
the work done
is about direct manipulation user interfaces. These are useful for many
other
kinds of software systems besides Etoys like environments. Professional
developers can make very good use of Morphic like frameworks. The
Morphic 2.0
system still represents the state of the art in this area. And Morphic
3.0 is a natural
evolution of Morphic 2.0.</p>

                  <p>I&#8217;d like to
thank Jecel Assumpção Jr. for
recommending me the ARK video, for reading this and for his kind and
useful comments.</p>
