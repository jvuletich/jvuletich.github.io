New in Cuis 2.0
Full Closure Support. With full closure support, you can finally use recursive blocks like here:	fac := [ :n | n > 1 ifTrue:  n * (fac value: n-1)] ifFalse: [1]].	fac value: 5. "120"and close over temps correctly, such as here:	(1 to: 10) do: [ :i | WorldState addDeferredUIMessage: [ Transcript cr; show: i ]].
This is nother closures example
	fib := [ :n | n < 2 ifTrue: [1] ifFalse: [(fib value: n-1) + (fib value: n-2)]].	fib value: 10. "89"
Cuis 2.0 is ready to run on the Cog VM (when available) and it requires a closures-enabled VM.
